Hi there! I'm Angel, a bilingual industrial drafter turned aspiring data analyst, blending technical precision with creative storytelling. With over six years of experience in 2D/3D modeling, product design, and technical drawing using AutoCAD and SolidWorks, I’ve recently shifted my focus to data analysis—where numbers meet narrative.
